## Lighting Talk
**Some reminders:**
* 3-5 minutes
* Can be done with slides or no slides (we'd love to see you try!)
* You will have access to a projecter and/or a whiteboard
* if you need any props, please let us know!
### Plan
> What do you want  to have your lighting talk about? It can be about anything like art to why JSX is bad, as long it's appropriate 
> How would the talk look like? Mention if you're going to have slides!!

* I want to talk about why tabs are better than spaces
* Show them the differnce of tabs and spaces
* give extreme and funny examples
* I will show code and use a  clip from the internet
* I will have slides and need a projecter

.. and so forth (You can also write a paragraph if you'd like)
